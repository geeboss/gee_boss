This contains and would contain more source codes for diferent functions,
kindly find the ones that suit you and you can as well reach out to me,
if you don't understand any of the codes or you need clearity on any of them.
I ensured I compiled those codes before i pushed them to github.
Don't worry about the correctness of my codes from this repository in particular.
Nobody wants to be affiliated with a wrong name.
As you can see this repository is named after my name or should I say my nickname.
The last sentence says a lot about many things, that you don't have to worried about now.


In essence you can reach out to me, through my mail
*geebolu261@gmail.com*.
I would add other ways of reaching out to me, for now stay put.
I would also be updating this readme file from time to time as I see fit
Incase you did not know I am using a book to learn Java programming language.
I would add the book here so you can access it also.
